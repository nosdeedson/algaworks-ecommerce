@Table is not necessary when we use iheritance strategy single table
with single table we have to specify the discriminator colunm and the values for which class in the hierarchy

@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE) // don't use identity for single table
private Integer id;

@MapsId this anotation makes the atribute to be the primary key in the table,usally used with EmbededeId

orphanRemoval delete de childrens of an object, like 'pedido' has 'itemPedido' if I use this anotation when a remove
the 'pedido' the 'itemPedido' will be removed too. This anotation works like a cascade remove.

This anotaion just works with we use the cascade type persist, otherwise this won't work
